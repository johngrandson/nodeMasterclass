# Homework Assignment #1 

Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want. 

### Running the project

Clone this repo in your machine, then in the terminal run:

```
cd app
node index.js
```

### Making Requests

You can use the postman, making a GET or POST request in the /hello endpoint.

```
http://localhost:3000/hello
```
